In GO

### How to use
* All input files go in the `input` folder.
* The line endings in input files should be `CRLF` or `LF`.
* Input files must be named `year$1day$2.txt`, where `$1` is the year, and `$2` is the day number.

### Building
Run `go build .`

### Commandline usage
Do `<executable> <year number> <day number>` to run the code for that day.
This requires the input file to be present, otherwise an error is thrown.
