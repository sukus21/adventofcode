# advent of code
In GO

### How to use
* All input files go in the `input` folder.
* The line endings in input files should be CRLF.
* Input files must be named `day*.txt`, where `*` is the day number.

### Building
Run `go build main.go`

### Commandline usage
Do `<executable> <day number>` to run the code for that day.
This requires the input file to be present, otherwise an error is thrown.
